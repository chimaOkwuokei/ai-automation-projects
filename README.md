# 🤖 Automation Projects Repository

Welcome to my collection of **workflow automations** built using tools like **n8n, Zapier, and Make**.  
This repo documents real-world automations I’ve built to save time, reduce repetitive work, and improve efficiency across different domains.

Each automation includes:
- 📌 Clear documentation (business problem → solution → workflow steps)  
- 🛠️ Setup requirements and tools used  
- ⏱️ Deployment time estimates  
- 💡 Value proposition and ROI  
- 🎥 Demo video walkthroughs  
- 📷 Workflow images/screenshots
