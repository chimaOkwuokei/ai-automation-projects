### 📊 Detailed Description
Currently, SDRs manually research leads on LinkedIn and other sources. This automation streamlines the process by:

1. Taking a list of leads from a CRM or Google Sheet.  
2. Enriching missing details (job title, company size, LinkedIn profile, industry, etc.).  
3. Validating email addresses for accuracy.  
4. Appending results back into the CRM/Google Sheet.  
5. Notifying the sales team when enrichment is complete.  

⏳ Saves ~20 hours/month and improves outreach effectiveness.
