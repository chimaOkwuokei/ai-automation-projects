## 📊 Detailed Description
Manually tracking contract expirations is time-consuming and error-prone.  
This automation solves the problem by maintaining a centralized contract database and running scheduled checks to alert relevant stakeholders in advance.

Key actions include:
1. Maintaining a structured repository of contracts with expiry metadata.  
2. Running a cron job daily or weekly to check for contracts expiring in **30/60/90 days**.  
3. Sending **internal email reminders** to assigned account managers.  
4. (Optional) Sending **customer reminder emails** to start renewal negotiations.  
5. Logging all actions for visibility and SLA compliance.
